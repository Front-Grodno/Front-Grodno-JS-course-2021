5. Code examples
6. Experience
7. Education (including courses, seminars, lectures, online training)
8. English (level and courses)

Technical requirements for CV:
1. Use semantic tags
2. Use [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate HTML
3. Use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for deploy
