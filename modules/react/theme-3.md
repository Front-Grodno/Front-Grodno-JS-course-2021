## Task 3.1
1. Implement `HTML` markup for required design for [Home](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/F9VXQ7IMZGY/#/screens/406802250) page (Only UI part) with all necessary components and apply styles for it. 
2. Use `<ErrorBoundary>` component for catching and displaying errors. You could create one component and wrap all your application or use several components.
3. For this part, no need to implement API calls and routing, the task can be done with mocked data.

## Task 3.2
1. Implement markup and styles for [Add movie](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/F9VXQ7IMZGY/#/screens/406802247), [Edit](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/F9VXQ7IMZGY/#/screens/406802252), [Delete](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/F9VXQ7IMZGY/#/screens/406802251) modal windows and `Sorting` on [Home](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/F9VXQ7IMZGY/#/screens/406802250) page.
3. **No need to implement real API calls. Only add pages with mocked data.**
4. No need to implement `hooks` in this task.
