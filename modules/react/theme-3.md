# Components

## Task 3.1
1. Implement `HTML` markup for required design for [Home](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/F9VXQ7IMZGY/#/screens/406802250) page (Only UI part) with all necessary components and apply styles for it. 
2. Use `<ErrorBoundary>` component for catching and displaying errors (https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html). You could create one component and wrap all your application or use several components.
