# React course

## Course objectives
- Get the theoretical base necessary for working with `React`, as well as for passing an interview.

### After the course you will be able to
- Develop `SPA` applications using basic `React` approaches.
- Control data flow.
- Separate work with data and view.
- Test the code.

## Practical task
Сreate a `single page application`, which will allow users to search, add and delete movies from the `Movies DB` database.
