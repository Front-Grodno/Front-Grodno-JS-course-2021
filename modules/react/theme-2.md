## Task 2
1. Create `package.json` file and install [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react), [Redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux), [React-Redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-redux), [React-Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router), [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest).
2. Install and configure [Webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack) & [Babel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/core) to get build artifact by running `npm` command.
4. Set `DEV` and `PROD` build configuration.
5. Use env variables, dev server, optimizations for `PROD` build.
6. Setup testing. You should have test command in your `package.json` file, which will run your future tests.
